# Password Reset Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of password reset functionality for the Brainswarming API.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated User Model**
   - Added `CanResetPassword` trait and implemented `CanResetPasswordContract` interface
   - This enables Laravel's built-in password reset functionality for the User model

2. **Added Controller Methods**
   - Added `forgotPassword` method to `AuthController` to handle sending password reset links
   - Added `resetPassword` method to `AuthController` to handle resetting passwords
   - Both methods include comprehensive Swagger documentation

3. **Added API Routes**
   - Added `/forgot-password` route for requesting password reset links
   - Added `/reset-password` route for resetting passwords
   - Updated existing authentication routes to use the AuthController methods

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added documentation for the new endpoints in the readme.md file
   - Updated the Authentication section to mention the password reset functionality
   - Regenerated Swagger documentation to include the new endpoints

## Testing Instructions

To test the password reset functionality:

1. **Request a Password Reset Link**
   ```
   POST /api/forgot-password
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "email": "user@example.com"
   }
   ```
   
   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "We have emailed your password reset link"
   }
   ```

2. **Check Email**
   - The user should receive an email with a password reset link
   - The link will contain a token that is required for the next step

3. **Reset Password**
   ```
   POST /api/reset-password
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "token": "token-from-email",
     "email": "user@example.com",
     "password": "new-password",
     "password_confirmation": "new-password"
   }
   ```
   
   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Your password has been reset"
   }
   ```

4. **Verify New Password**
   - Try logging in with the new password to verify it was reset successfully

## Configuration

The password reset functionality uses Laravel's built-in password reset features, which require proper email configuration. Ensure the following are set in your `.env` file:

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=your-smtp-port
MAIL_USERNAME=your-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

## Troubleshooting

If password reset emails are not being sent:
1. Check your email configuration in `.env`
2. Verify that the user exists in the database
3. Check the Laravel logs for any errors

If password reset is not working:
1. Ensure the token is valid and not expired
2. Verify that the email matches the one used to request the reset
3. Check that the password meets the minimum requirements (8 characters)
